## [Unreleased]

Where the 0.12.1 option-margin work met the Nautilus-parity work on this
branch.

### Fixed

- **A fill produced by a book walk re-prices the option groups.**
  `PortfolioSession::walk_book` lends the kernel the pool's capital,
  matches, and reconciles the result back exactly as the step path does, so
  a leg it opens or closes changes what the groups hold. It now regroups on
  the same terms. Before this, buying a wing off the standing book left the
  sold leg it covers locked at its full naked deposit.
- **A sold option's entry fee is quantized as it is booked.** The deposit
  path subtracted it from cash directly, outside the settlement rule every
  other term on this branch goes through, so a currency with a declared
  precision carried a sub-cent residue on the entry.

### Changed

- **The unfunded-sizing guard asks the funding mode, not the leverage
  rate.** A per-contract deposit cannot answer "what rate funds this",
  which is what the guard used to ask. It now asks each mode in its own
  terms: a zero rate funds nothing, and so would a zero deposit. No
  reachable deposit is zero today -- one is built only from a positive
  rate, strike and multiplier -- so nothing changes in behaviour; the guard
  simply keeps answering the question the entry path now poses.
- **The entry booking site reads the funding cost computed above it**
  rather than re-deriving it once per funding mode, so the two cannot
  drift. The arithmetic is unchanged, term for term and in the same order.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-09-02

Sold options that hedge each other are margined as one group, and the
leverage-rate margin path is bit-identical to 0.11 again.

**In plain words: a sold put protected by a bought put can only lose the
gap between them, and a sold call beside a sold put on the same index
cannot both lose at once. An exchange charges such pairs far less than two
separate deposits. 0.12 charged every sold leg its full deposit, which
refused spreads a real account carries easily; the portfolio session now
re-prices sold legs on one underlying and expiry as a group once they are
open together.**

### Added

- **Position-group margin** (`portfolio::option_groups`). After every
  applied event the session gathers open, deposit-modelled option legs by
  `(underlying, expiry)` and locks the group's requirement across its sold
  legs: a scenario component charged once — the largest sold leg's
  `span_pct` deposit when some short side is uncovered, the structure's
  intrinsic worst loss when every short is covered — plus `exposure_pct`
  on each sold leg's notional, less the net premium the group collected,
  floored at the structure's worst loss net of premium. Held in tests to
  within 5% of one broker's basket margin for a sold straddle, a bull put
  spread and an iron condor (measured 2026-09-02). Bought legs keep locking
  their premium. Cash accounts and legs without the deposit model are
  untouched.
- **`underlying` on `InstrumentSpec.option` decides the group.** Legs with
  no declared underlying group by their own symbol, i.e. never with
  another leg.
- **`ctx.equity`, `ctx.cash` and `ctx.free_capital` on the portfolio
  strategy context**, the same three the single-strategy context already
  carried, so a multi-instrument strategy can read what a new entry may
  draw on without reaching into the session.

### Changed

- **Maintenance follows the group.** A sold leg's maintenance requirement is
  its group share, so a hedged pair is not margin-called at a level only
  two naked deposits would have breached.
- **Sizing a NEW sold leg still uses its naked deposit.** The group benefit
  arrives once the leg is on — freeing capital for later entries and
  lowering maintenance — so a leg must be carriable on its own before it
  may lean on its hedge. This is the conservative order and it is
  deliberate.

### Fixed

- **Margin-account sizing and locking on the rate path** evaluate
  `contract_value × (rate + fee)` and `contract_value × size × rate` in
  the 0.11 order again, pinned by a bit-exact test. The sold-option deposit
  path (`span_pct`/`exposure_pct`) is unaffected.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-02

Sold options reserve an exchange-style deposit, and the reason a sized entry
came out at zero now says whether margin or lot size was the cause.

**In plain words: selling an option collects a small premium but can lose
without limit, so a real account must set aside a deposit scaled to the
underlying's value — many times the premium. A margin-account backtest used
to charge a sold option only its premium, so a small book could sell far
more lots than any broker would allow and report a profit no account could
have earned. An option spec can now carry that deposit, sizing and margin
use it, and a book too small to carry it books no trade and says so.**

### Added

- **`span_pct` and `exposure_pct` on `InstrumentSpec.option`** — the
  risk-scenario and exposure components of a sold option's deposit, each as
  a fraction of the underlying notional at the strike. Per contract the
  engine reserves `(span_pct + exposure_pct) × strike × multiplier`; the
  premium collected stays in the balance, the way a broker credits it and
  blocks the deposit separately. Both default to `0.0`, which leaves a sold
  option funded at its premium exactly as before — every existing result,
  and the golden corpus, is byte-identical. Bought options are unaffected:
  a buyer can lose only the premium, so they keep the account's rate path
  (the full premium at leverage 1.0).
  The kernel has no spot series, so the strike stands in for spot — the
  at-the-money case, the largest requirement and the safe side to err on.
- **`RejectReason::InsufficientMargin`** (`"insufficient_margin"`, reported
  to strategies as `InsufficientMargin`) — capital-fraction sizing landed on
  zero contracts because an instrument-level margin requirement (a sold
  option's deposit, a future's `margin_init`) exceeded the available
  capital, as distinct from `ZeroSize`, where the lot's own notional did.
  Telling a user "loosen the entry" is the one thing that cannot help when
  the strategy was never reached; now the reason says which floor it was.

### Changed

- **Sizing and margin share one per-contract requirement.** Under a margin
  account the sizing denominator, the locked initial margin and the
  maintenance requirement all read the same figure: a sold option's modelled
  deposit, else `contract_value × margin_init` (or `1/leverage`). A sold
  option's maintenance requirement IS its locked deposit, so a margin call
  fires when equity falls below the deposit — the broker's rule — rather
  than below a fraction of the premium's notional. With the model off,
  every path reduces to the 0.11 arithmetic.

### Unreleased-since-0.11.0, released here

Premium-only runners can now fill at a real opening premium, and the golden
corpus covers the multi-leg runners.

**In plain words: under next-bar-open timing, an options or spread trade was
filled at the next bar's settled premium, because those runners carry one
premium per bar and have no opening price to fill at. That stays true when
no open data exists — nothing is ever invented — but callers who HAVE the
premiums' opening prices can now pass them in, and signal fills then price
at the open the market actually traded, exactly like the equity runners.**

### Added

- **`option_open_prices` on `run_options_backtest`, `legs_open_premiums` on
  `run_spread_backtest` and `BatchSpreadItem`** — optional opening-premium
  series, mirroring the premium series' shape (a mismatch raises
  `ValueError`). Consulted only under `fill_timing="next_bar_open"`, and in
  the spread runner only for SIGNAL entries and exits: expiry settlement,
  squareoff, max-loss and target-profit closes are forced or protective
  exits against current marks and keep pricing there. Absent the series,
  the next bar's settled value remains the fill, as in 0.11.0.
- **Golden fixtures for the basket, pairs, options, and spread runners** —
  eight new pinned runs (each runner in both `same_bar_close` and
  `next_bar_open`, the latter exercising the premium-open path where the
  runner accepts one), with their inputs frozen alongside. The multi-leg
  execution cores were previously outside the bit-exact gate entirely.
  Every pre-existing fixture is byte-identical.

- **An unfunded margin venue: `leverage=float("inf")`** — locks no initial
  margin, so no order is refused for want of capital and the balance moves
  only with realized PnL and fees. That is what an instrument declaring
  `margin_init = 0` trades like (every Nautilus equity does), and a cash
  account is not a mirror of one: it refuses the orders such a venue filled.
  Accepted by `run_strategy_backtest` and `run_portfolio_strategy` alike.
- **`RejectReason::UnfundedSizing` (`unfunded_sizing`)** — a size given as a
  fraction of capital is refused when the account funds nothing, because
  the fraction names no size: there is no capital requirement to divide by.
  Previously the division fell through to the fee rate alone (and to
  infinity where there was no fee), sizing a position at hundreds of times
  the balance. Explicit unit sizes are unaffected.

- **`generate.py --replay`** — recomputes the golden baselines from the
  inputs already frozen in `fixtures.json`. A deliberate regeneration should
  move the engine's numbers without moving the market they were measured on,
  and re-running `make_data` moves both.

- **`PortfolioSession.walk_book(instrument, ts_now)`** — settles one
  instrument's resting orders against the market it last saw, without
  consuming a bar. A venue walks every book it keeps each time it drains a
  batch of commands, so an order resting on one name meets the book again
  whenever the strategy acts on another; a driver that steps only the
  instrument whose bar is in hand under-fills everything resting elsewhere.
  This is the resting-order phase of a step and nothing else -- no bar
  arrives, so nothing is replayed onto the tape, no exit or entry is
  evaluated, nothing expires, and no equity point is sampled. A fill it
  produces is dated to `ts_now`.

### Changed

- **Golden baselines regenerated for the Nautilus-parity fee arithmetic.**
  Percentage fees are now one correctly-rounded `price * size * rate`
  product (NAUTILUS_PARITY.md item 6) instead of a left-to-right
  accumulation, so pinned fees moved by one ULP and `lots_and_cap`'s equity
  curve and metrics moved with them -- at most 1.4e-14 relative, on a Sharpe
  ratio. No trade count, fill price, size or exit reason changed in any
  fixture, and the frozen inputs are byte-identical.

- **A bar now costs what it does, not what the run has already done.**
  `OrderEngine.orders` is the record of a run -- every order ever submitted,
  kept forever -- and five call sites walked all of it to find the handful
  still working, while every bar rebuilt a parent-status map of the whole
  ledger. The cost of a bar was proportional to the run's history rather
  than its activity, making a run quadratic in its own length and landing
  hardest on long sweeps. An order's id is now its index in the ledger (ids
  come from a counter and nothing is removed or reordered), and a `working`
  list holds the ids that may still be live, pruned lazily on each match
  pass. Stepping a 46k-bar session that placed ~3.2k orders: 3.050s ->
  0.141s, with no behavioural change.

### Fixed

- **An order that reached the venue before its bar now rests into that bar.**
  An order carrying `arrival_ns` was matched against the book standing when
  it arrived and, if it did not cross, sat out the rest of that bar entirely
  -- it could not fill before the *next* one, even though it had been working
  at the venue the whole time that bar printed. A basket's limits are priced
  off a bar the venue has not seen yet and mostly do not cross on arrival, so
  this delayed a large share of a portfolio run's fills by a bar and priced
  them at the wrong print. The bar an order beat is now its own to be filled
  from, at its limit, like any resting order the market comes to; reading its
  range is not look-ahead, because the order was there before it printed. An
  immediate (IOC/FOK) order still dies against the book it arrived at, and an
  order submitted *from* its bar still never meets that bar's range.
  `MatchOutcome::Fill` gained `on_arrival` so a fill is dated to the arrival
  instant only when it was actually taken from the standing book.

- **A closing order now reduces by the size it asks for.** An order meeting
  an open position closed all of it and ignored its own quantity, so a
  one-lot trim of eleven held units flattened the book -- ten units of
  exposure a venue would still have been holding, and every later fill and
  mark measured against a position that no longer existed. The close is now
  bounded by the order's size as well as by the position and the bar's
  liquidity, and an order that asked for less than is held reports itself
  filled rather than leaving a phantom remainder to expire. Asking for the
  whole position is still spelled by naming no size at all
  (`QtySpec::FullPosition`, the Python API's default), and a capital
  fraction still names units of an entry rather than of a reduction, so
  neither changes.

- **A position's size stays on the instrument's lot grid.** A position opened
  by two fills held their float sum, and that sum need not land where either
  fill did: 0.03835 + 0.04381 is 0.08216000000000001, so selling the 0.08216
  that was bought left 1.4e-17 of a coin open. Nothing could ever close that,
  so the position never went flat and every later entry averaged into it --
  a run of forty-odd round trips reported one that never ended, at an entry
  price no fill was made at. The cash account was correct throughout; only
  the book was wrong. The ledger now snaps a position size back onto the
  instrument's size grid after every add and reduction, and reports a round
  trip's closed size the same way. Without an instrument declaring a grid,
  nothing changes.

- **A resumed order asks for the remainder the venue still owes.** An order's
  total and the fills against it are grid quantities, but their binary
  difference need not be: 0.07841 filled down to 0.06531 leaves
  1309.9999999999986 lots, and flooring that asked for 0.01309 -- a lot less
  than the 0.01310 still outstanding. The order finished short, called itself
  partially filled with a sliver no bar would absorb, and left the shortfall
  in the book. The remainder is now read off the same grid the order's
  quantities sit on, both where a resumed order sizes itself and where a fill
  reports its leaves.

- **An account settles each amount it books, not their sum.** A position's
  realized PnL was already a sum of whole-unit bookings, but the cash
  balance still added the raw product and rounded only the running total, so
  the two accountants could disagree. Every term reaching an account is
  already money -- the proceeds of the units sold, a fill's realized gross,
  the commission on it -- and each is now quantized as it is booked. The
  difference needs an average entry that is not a round unit, which a
  position built by two fills at two prices supplies: thirty shares bought
  as 25 at 70.04 and five at 70.05 average to 70.041666..., so taking 27 of
  them back at 69.98 realizes exactly minus one and sixty-six and a half
  cents, and rounding the sum carries that half cent on into the balance. A
  nine-instrument long/short run over seven months ended two cents from the
  reference engine on nothing else at all. Without an instrument declaring
  a currency precision there is no unit to settle in, and the balance is the
  same additions in the same order, bit for bit.

- **A closing order larger than the position reverses it.** A netting venue
  does not stop at flat: it closes what it holds and opens the remainder in
  the order's own direction, which is how one rebalance order turns a long
  into a short and the only way a long/short book reverses a name. The
  engine stopped at flat and dropped the remainder, so such a book could
  only ever be flattened. The fill is now split into a leg that closes and a
  leg that opens, both at the same match price -- one market action trades at
  one price -- with the commission the venue billed once prorated between
  them by size rather than charged to each, since a schedule with a
  per-order floor is not linear in size. A reduce-only order still stops at
  flat, an order naming no size or a capital fraction has no remainder to
  flip into, and a bar too thin to absorb more than the position closes it
  and leaves the rest working.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-31

Open-mode execution no longer trades on information from the future.

**In plain words: a strategy decides at a bar's close, using everything that
bar showed. With `upon_bar_close=False`, the engine then executed that
decision at the same bar's OPENING price — a price the market had already
left behind before the decision existed. That is a time machine, and it
inflated every result run in this mode: on a fixture where one bar rallies
100 → 200 and every later price is 150, a strategy whose signal fires on
that close reported +50.0% — a profit no real trader could earn, since 100
never traded again once the signal existed. The same run now reports 0.0%,
buying at the next bar's open like a real order would. Every mature engine
surveyed (backtrader, zipline, LEAN, NautilusTrader, vnpy) enforces exactly
this next-bar contract; none fills a close-decided signal at that bar's
open.**

### Fixed

- **`upon_bar_close=False` now means next-bar-open, not same-bar-open.** A
  signal decided on bar i fills at bar i+1's open — never at bar i's own
  open. The fill is structurally unreachable on the decision bar: the
  deferred intent is consumed at the top of the next bar's step, before any
  code that could create a new one runs. A position opened at bar i+1's open
  lives through bar i+1, so its stop or target can fire within the fill bar.
- **Order-API market orders follow the same contract in this mode.** An
  order submitted while observing bar i is acknowledged on bar i's step and
  fills at bar i+1's open. In `same_bar_close` mode (the default) nothing
  changes: market orders still fill on their submission bar at its close.
- **Margin-call liquidation prices at the breaching bar's close.** The
  breach is detected marking equity at the close; the old open-based fill
  liquidated at a price from before the detection. Close-mode results are
  unchanged (the two coincided).

### Changed

- **New `fill_timing` policy on `BacktestConfig`** —
  `"same_bar_close"` (decide and fill at bar i's close, the default),
  `"next_bar_open"` (decide at bar i's close, fill at bar i+1's open), and
  `"same_bar_open_lookahead"` (the pre-0.11 behavior, named for what it is;
  see Migration). `upon_bar_close` is **deprecated** and maps onto the
  policy (`True` → `"same_bar_close"`, `False` → `"next_bar_open"`); an
  explicit `fill_timing` wins over the bool.
- **The basket, pairs, options, and spread runners now honor the timing
  policy.** They previously ignored `upon_bar_close` entirely and always
  filled at the decision bar's close — causally valid, and still their
  behavior under the default. Under `"next_bar_open"` a decision executes
  on the following bar: at each leg's own open where the series carries one
  (basket, pairs), and at the following bar's premium for premium-only
  series (options, spread legs), which have no open to fill at. Decision-
  time information stays on the decision bar: the pairs hedge ratio and the
  options strike are computed from data available when the signal fired.
  Spread expiry settlement, squareoff, max-loss and target-profit closes
  are forced or protective exits and keep filling on their own bar.
- **Streaming sessions surface deferred fills one step later.** In
  `"next_bar_open"` mode, a `KernelSession`/`EventSession` step that
  carries an entry or exit signal returns no `Entered`/`Exited` event;
  the event arrives on the next step, priced at that bar's open.

### Notes

- A decision on the final bar never fills in `"next_bar_open"` mode —
  there is no next bar to fill it on. End-of-data finalization still
  closes open positions at the last close, as before.
- The tick path is unaffected: a tick fill happens at the print itself,
  which is already causal, and a print carries no "next open".
- Resting orders (limit, stop, at-open, at-close) already matched from the
  bar after submission and are unchanged.
- `FillModel.delay_to_next_bar` and `FillModel::at_next_open()` — dead
  code that was never consulted — are removed; `fill_timing` supersedes
  them.

### Migration

- Results previously produced with `upon_bar_close=False` are **not
  comparable** to 0.11 results and were optimistically biased. To reproduce
  them exactly:

  ```python
  config = raptorbt.BacktestConfig(fill_timing="same_bar_open_lookahead")
  ```

  The name states what it does: it fills a bar's signal at that same bar's
  open, a price from before the signal's information existed. Use it only
  to reproduce pre-0.11 numbers.
- Results produced with the default `upon_bar_close=True` are unchanged —
  the golden corpus is byte-identical across this release.
- Pin `raptorbt>=0.11.0,<0.12.0`.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-08-30

Averages over an empty set now report "undefined" instead of zero.

**In plain words: a backtest where every trade won still reported "average
losing trade: 0.00" and "average losing trade duration: 0.00" -- figures
describing trades that do not exist. Zero is a measurement; it says the losers
broke even. The honest answer is that there were no losers, so there is
nothing to average. These four now come back empty, the way profit factor
already did.**

### Changed

- **`avg_win_pct`, `avg_loss_pct`, `avg_winning_duration` and
  `avg_losing_duration` are now `Option<f64>`** (Python: `float | None`), and
  are `None` when their population is empty -- no winning trade, or no losing
  trade. Previously each returned `0.0`, which is indistinguishable from a real
  measurement of zero and reads as a claim about trades that were never taken.
  Measured on a two-leg straddle that closed two winners and no losers: the
  stored row carried `avg_loss_pct = 0.00` and `avg_losing_duration = 0.00`
  beside a 100% win rate.

  This is the same rule 0.10.3 applied to `calmar_ratio` and that
  `profit_factor` already followed: a quantity with no denominator, or no
  population, is undefined rather than zero.

  `payoff_ratio` is unaffected -- it reads both averages through
  `unwrap_or(0.0)`, reproducing its previous branch exactly.

### Migration

Callers reading these four fields must handle `None`. In Python they arrive as
`None` and can be formatted like any other optional metric; a caller that
previously relied on the `0.0` fallback for arithmetic should decide
explicitly whether "no such trades" should score as zero or be skipped.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-08-30

Calmar is no longer annualized, and every runner now computes it the same way.

**In plain words: the results panel showed a risk score of 115,906.80 where
anything above about 5 is implausible. The number was not corrupt -- it came
from a formula that stretches a run's profit out to a full year before
dividing by the worst loss along the way. Over five days that stretch is
enormous, so the shorter the backtest, the sillier the number got. Calmar now
divides profit by the worst loss directly, with no stretching, which is what
the README always said it did.**

### Fixed

- **`calmar_ratio` is no longer annualized.** `PortfolioEngine` computed it as
  **CAGR / max drawdown**, compounding the run's return up to a full year from
  elapsed wall-clock time with no minimum-window floor. Measured on a real
  5.27-day options backtest: a 15.4971% return against an 18.6952% drawdown
  compounded to a CAGR of 2.17e4 and reported **Calmar = 115,906.80**. The
  same inputs now give **0.83**. The shorter the run the worse it got -- one
  day of the same strategy reported ~3.7e23 -- and a value large enough to
  overflow `NUMERIC(10,4)` had previously been observed downstream.

  Because the ratio carries no time term, a caller comparing two strategies is
  now comparing the strategies rather than their window lengths.

- **All six call sites share one definition.** `metrics::drawdown::calmar_ratio`
  already implemented the plain ratio and nothing called it. `PortfolioEngine`
  annualized; `StreamingMetrics`, `MultiStrategyBacktest`, the basket, pairs
  and options runners each carried their own inline copy. The same strategy
  therefore reported a Calmar differing by five orders of magnitude depending
  only on which runner executed it. Every one of them now calls the shared
  function.

- **A profitable run with no drawdown reports "undefined", not "terrible".**
  The multi-strategy, pairs and options runners returned `0.0` when max
  drawdown was zero, which reads as the worst possible score; the correct
  answer is that the ratio is undefined. They now return `f64::INFINITY`,
  which crosses to Python as `None` like every other undefined ratio.

### Notes

- `annualization::elapsed_years` and `LEGACY_CALMAR_DAYS` are retained. Calmar
  no longer calls either, but both are public API with their own tests.
- Results stored by earlier versions keep their annualized values. A Calmar
  compared across the 0.10.2/0.10.3 boundary is comparing two definitions.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-08-30

Holding-period seconds now survive a tick session, where they were always
dropped.

**In plain words: 0.10.1 taught the engine to report how long a trade lasted
in real time rather than in bars. On tick runs that number never arrived — it
came back empty every time, and a caller with nothing to render fell back to
the bar count, so a scalping strategy still reported "132 bars" for a hold
that really lasted about four minutes. The measurement was being thrown away
before anyone saw it.**

### Fixed

- **`avg_holding_period_secs` is no longer `None` on every tick backtest.**
  The average was computed by looking up each trade's `entry_idx` / `exit_idx`
  in the equity timeline. Those indices count **events**, while the timeline
  holds one entry per **equity sample** — and on a tick session equity is
  sampled once per print while quotes advance the index too. Measured on one
  session of a liquid NSE equity (28,642 prints against 28,635 quotes), a
  trade closing on the final event carried `exit_idx = 57276` against a
  28,642-entry timeline. The lookup missed, every span was discarded, and the
  "cover every trade or report nothing" guard then correctly returned `None`
  for the whole run.

  The span now comes from the trade's own `entry_time` / `exit_time`, which
  every production path already populates from the same clock. Bar runs are
  unaffected — there one event is one bar, so the old indexing happened to
  agree — and both existing duration tests pass unchanged.

  A tick run that reported no holding duration at all now reports a real one:
  a two-hour hold measures 7,200 s.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-28

Duration metrics are now reported in **real elapsed time** as well as in bars,
and time-in-market can no longer exceed 100%.

**In plain words: the engine measured how long a trade lasted by counting
bars. On daily data one bar is one day, so that was right by accident. On a
tick run one bar is one tick, so a trade lasting 45 seconds was reported as
"329" -- and a caller printing that as days showed 329 days. A six-day
backtest reported a drawdown lasting roughly 256 years. The bar counts are
still there and still mean bars; alongside them the engine now reports the
same figures in seconds, taken from the timestamps it already had.**

### Added

- `BacktestMetrics.max_drawdown_duration_secs` and
  `BacktestMetrics.avg_holding_period_secs` (Rust), exposed as
  `metrics.max_drawdown_duration_secs` / `metrics.avg_holding_period_secs`
  and `to_dict()["Max Drawdown Duration [s]"]` (Python). Both are `None`
  when the run carried no usable timestamps -- "cannot say" rather than a
  zero that reads as a real measurement.

### Fixed

- `exposure_pct` could exceed 100%. Concurrent positions each contribute
  their own holding period, and the sum was divided by a single equity
  curve, so a netting book with overlapping trades reported more time in
  the market than the backtest ran -- 123.5% observed on a real run. Time
  in the market is now capped at the time available.

### Notes for callers

`max_drawdown_duration` and `avg_holding_period` are unchanged and still
count **bars**. Anything rendered to a person should read the `_secs`
fields and fall back to the bar counts only when they are `None`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-27

Backtest metrics now report **total turnover** -- the total traded
notional across the run, both sides counted.

**In plain words: a result used to say only what you made on the money you
started with. It now also says how much money actually moved through the
market. A round trip is two legs -- buying Rs 1,00,000 of stock and
selling it back is Rs 2,00,000 of turnover -- because that is exactly the
per-leg value fees are charged on, so `total_fees_paid / total_turnover`
is a meaningful cost rate. Two strategies with the same return but very
different churn stop looking identical.**

### Added

- `BacktestMetrics.total_turnover` (Rust) and
  `metrics.total_turnover` / `to_dict()["Total Turnover"]` (Python):
  every entry leg plus every exit leg that really traded, at
  `price * |size|` -- the same base the fee models charge on. Exit legs
  that never crossed the market contribute nothing: `EndOfData` (the run
  ended while still holding) and `Settlement` (an option left to expire)
  pay no exit fee and move no money. `Squareoff` and `Liquidation` are
  real trade-outs and count.
- Result paths that carry no trade list report `0.0`, meaning "not
  measured", never "measured as zero".

### Notes

- The contract multiplier is deliberately **not** folded in, matching the
  fee models (which also charge on `price * |size|`): for
  multiplier-bearing instruments both figures share the same per-point
  unit, so their ratio stays exact.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-20

The Indian cost schedules now match the broker's published schedule
(zerodha.com/charges, verified 2026-08-20), and every rate is pinned by a
test against that source. Backtest and rebalance costs change for every
segment; equity delivery and small-order costs change the most.

**In plain words: buying and selling costs money in several ways -- broker
fees and government taxes. The old numbers charged a Rs 20 broker fee on
delivery trades where the broker actually charges nothing, always charged the
full Rs 20 on small trades where the broker's percentage rate is cheaper, and
used tax rates for futures and options that were two statutory increases out
of date. Every backtest was slightly wrong; small delivery backtests were
very wrong (47 bps of phantom fees on a Rs 10,000 position).**

### Changed

- **Equity delivery brokerage is now zero** (was a flat Rs 20 per order).
- **Intraday equity and all futures brokerage is now min(Rs 20, 0.03% of
  order value)** (was an unconditional Rs 20). Options stay flat Rs 20.
- **F&O STT raised to the rates effective 2026-04-01** (Budget 2026-27):
  futures 0.01% → 0.05% sell-side; options 0.0625% → 0.15% of sell-side
  premium. The old values predated *both* the 2024-10-01 and 2026-04-01
  statutory increases.
- **MCX futures now levy CTT** (0.01% non-agri sell side; was zero -- "no STT
  on commodity futures" ignored the commodities transaction tax).
- Exchange transaction charges corrected to the published values (all
  sub-0.1 bps): NSE equity 0.00345% → 0.00307%, NFO futures 0.002% →
  0.00183%, NFO options 0.035% → 0.03553%, MCX 0.002%/0.035% →
  0.0021%/0.0418%, CDS options 0.031% → 0.0311%.
- Currency (CDS) stamp duty corrected to 0.0001% (Rs 10/crore) buy-side; the
  old values were 10x (futures) and 30x (options) the published rate.

### Breaking

- `CostSchedule.brokerage_per_order` is replaced by `brokerage_flat` +
  `brokerage_rate` (charge per order = `min(flat, rate * value)` when
  `rate > 0`, else `flat`). `indian_cost_schedule()` exports the two new keys
  and no longer carries `brokerage_per_order` -- deliberately, so a stale
  consumer fails loudly instead of reading the cap as the charge.

### Deliberate approximations (stated, not hidden)

- BSE equity / BFO derivatives share the NSE-family schedules; their
  published exchange-transaction rates differ by under 0.2 bps and execution
  truth for the platform is Zerodha on NSE/NFO.
- STT on *exercised* options (0.15% of intrinsic) is not modelled; the engine
  trades out of positions rather than simulating exercise.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-18

Patch. The optimizer now refuses a book whose post-solve snapping pushed a
weight past a cap, instead of returning it. No behaviour changes for any run
that was already inside its caps.

**In plain words: you tell the optimizer the most it may put in any one stock.
After it picks the weights, it undoes trades too small to be worth making --
that keeps the book from churning over trivial adjustments. Undoing a trade can
leave a holding sitting above the limit you set, and nothing checked. The engine
handed the book back as if it were fine.**

Measured: with `no_trade_band = 0.02` the largest weight came back at **0.0980
against an 8% cap** -- 22.5% over a limit a mandate treats as hard, with no
error, no warning, and a `Solved` status.

The module header had admitted the hazard in prose since the feature landed
("never rescaled across other names, which could breach a cap") while only the
CASH budget was actually re-checked afterwards.

### Why it was latent rather than live

`book_optimizer.py` in the backend never passes `no_trade_band`, so production
could not reach this. It becomes reachable the moment anyone sets one -- which
is a reasonable thing to want, since a no-trade band is exactly how you stop a
book churning on tiny adjustments.

### Fixed

- **Post-snap weights are re-checked against every cap they can breach.**
  `position_cap`, `short_cap`, the per-sector totals and `gross_max`, each
  refusing with `PortfolioMathError::Infeasible` and the arithmetic that
  breached -- the same shape as the existing cash and net-exposure guards.
  Never clamped: clamping would silently re-open the stranded-weight problem
  those guards exist to catch.

- **The check applies to a PARTIAL snap only.** When every diff snaps away the
  status-quo book stands, and a book that already exists is feasible by
  definition -- a live holding may legitimately sit above the cap, which binds
  the target, not what is already owned. Refusing there would block every
  rebalance of a concentrated book, which is precisely the book that most needs
  one.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-14

Minor. Spread legs now settle on their own expiry dates instead of the whole
structure closing when the first one expires. This is what makes calendar and
diagonal spreads measurable; it also rejects an input that used to be accepted.

**In plain words: a calendar spread sells an option expiring soon and buys one
expiring later. The whole trade is the gap between the two -- the near one dies
and the far one keeps living. The engine closed both the moment the near one
expired, so it never simulated the part of the trade that is the trade. If you
have backtested a calendar or a diagonal on any earlier release, the number it
gave you was not a number about your strategy. Same-expiry structures --
straddles, strangles, verticals, iron condors, butterflies -- are unaffected and
produce identical results.**

### Why this one is worse than an optimistic result

An over-optimistic backtest is still informative: you can discount it. This was
not that. Because the engine closed at the first expiry, nothing the surviving
leg did afterwards reached the P&L at all -- so the same structure reported the
same figure no matter how the trade turned out.

Selling the near leg at 50 (expiring worthless) and buying the far leg at 80,
on a 75 lot, with the far leg free to settle anywhere:

| Far leg settles at | Reported | The truth | Error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 120 | 3,750 | 6,750 | +3,000 |
| 100 | 3,750 | 5,250 | +1,500 |
| 80 | 3,750 | 3,750 | 0 |
| 60 | 3,750 | 2,250 | -1,500 |
| 30 | 3,750 | 0 | -3,750 |

The error changes sign, so it is not a bias that could be corrected for -- the
result is uncorrelated with the trade. And it was silent: no error, no warning,
no NaN, just a clean-looking P&L stamped `exit_reason=Settlement`.

### Fixed

- **Each leg settles at its own expiry, and the survivors keep marking.**
  `spreads.rs` tested `expiries.iter().any(...)`, force-closing the whole
  position at the earliest leg expiry. Legs now carry their own settled state;
  the structure closes when the last one goes.

- **A settled leg's profit is credited once, not twice.** It leaves the
  mark-to-market and enters cash on its expiry bar. Those are the two halves of
  the equity line, so equity does not move across a settlement at all -- the
  accounting is invisible, as it should be. The reported P&L is reconciled
  against the account's actual gain end to end.

- **A settled leg is frozen at what it settled for.** Its contract no longer
  exists, so whatever the premium series carries past that bar is not a price.
  A stale quote there can no longer reach the exit price or the P&L.

- **A settled leg pays no exit cost; a surviving leg still pays full.** An
  option left to expire is never sold, so no order is placed and no brokerage
  or transaction tax is owed. Entry costs are unchanged either way -- the order
  that opened the leg was real regardless of how it ended.

- **A spread containing a dead leg is not re-entered.** The re-entry block
  waited for every leg to expire; one is enough. Identical for same-expiry
  structures, where the two conditions coincide.

### Changed

- **`leg_expiry_timestamps` must carry one entry per leg.** Expiries are matched
  to legs by position, so a shorter list left the trailing legs immortal and a
  longer one settled on a date belonging to no leg -- silently, in both cases.
  `run_spread_backtest` now raises `ValueError` naming both counts.

  **This is the breaking change in this release.** Any caller passing a
  correctly-sized list is unaffected.

- **The engine still does not compute intrinsic value, and now says so.** The
  contract is documented on `leg_expiry_timestamps`: the premium series must
  carry the leg's settlement value at and after its expiry, and the engine
  freezes the leg there. A caller settling options against the underlying
  substitutes intrinsic itself. Two implementations of the same number, silently
  reconciled, would be a worse defect than the one this release fixes.

- **`run_spread_backtest` has a real type stub.** It was `*args, **kwargs`,
  which told a type checker nothing about a function with eleven parameters.

### Not in this release

- **`batch_spread_backtest` still passes no expiries**, so batch runs never
  settle at expiry. That is correct by omission rather than an oversight, and is
  now marked as such in the source. Wiring it in needs a new field on the item
  class, its stub, and a test.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-08-14

Patch. The last two strategy paths that computed their own trading costs --
tick and options -- now use the engine's fee model like every other path. Both
under-charged, and both reported less than they charged.

**In plain words: if you backtested a tick strategy or a single-leg option, the
costs it reported were too low and the profit too high. How much depends on how
many contracts you traded: the bigger the position, the wider the gap. Anything
that looked marginally profitable is worth running again.**

Release 0.7.3 fixed this same family of defect for spreads, pairs, baskets and
portfolios. These are the remaining two.

### The tick path

The tick strategy path priced every backtest as if you had traded exactly one
unit, whatever you actually traded.

**In plain words: a tick backtest charged one unit's costs, earned one unit's
profit, and then measured that one-unit profit against your entire account. If
you traded a 75-lot option, it reported roughly 1/75th of your real profit and
1/75th of your real costs, and your return, drawdown and Sharpe were all
computed from the wrong number. Costs and profit were wrong by the same factor,
so the trade list looked entirely self-consistent -- it was simply describing a
position nobody held.**

This resolves the gap 0.7.3 recorded as *"the tick strategy path computes fees
from price alone and does not scale them by position size."* That description
was accurate but understated the defect in two ways, both fixed here.

### Fixed

- **Costs and P&L scale with the position traded.** `tick.rs` computed
  `entry_price * fees` and `(exit_price - entry_price) * 1.0`, with `size` hard-
  coded to `1.0` on every emitted trade. It now scales both by
  `|quantity| * lot_size`.

  The 0.7.3 note named only the fee half. The P&L half matters more: because
  `build_result` adds per-trade P&L to a real `initial_capital`, a per-unit
  profit was being accumulated against a full-size account, so the equity curve,
  the returns series, the drawdown curve and every metric derived from them were
  wrong -- not just the cost line.

- **The "caller scales by lot_size" contract was unfulfillable.** A comment in
  the tick loop instructed callers to scale the result themselves. The only
  caller is `run_tick_backtest`, whose signature had no lot-size or quantity
  parameter, so no caller could have complied and none did. The comment is gone
  and the engine does the scaling.

- **`fee_segment` reaches the tick path.** `tick.rs` never imported a fee model
  -- it hand-rolled `price * rate` inline -- and the binding built its config
  with `..Default::default()`, so the itemized regulatory schedule was
  unreachable from a tick backtest by two independent routes. Both are closed;
  this path now uses `BacktestConfig::fee_model()` like every other strategy.

  This is the same defect 0.7.3 fixed for spreads, and it matters for the same
  reason: brokerage is a flat charge per order, and a purely proportional model
  cannot express it at any rate. Measured on a 75-lot round trip against
  `fee_segment="NFO-OPT"`:

  | Premium | Flat rate as % of the real schedule |
  | --- | --- |
  | 2 | 0.6% |
  | 20 | 6.1% |
  | 100 | 25.7% |

- **Each charge lands on the side that owes it.** Entry and exit are priced
  through `calculate_side`, so transaction tax falls on the sell and stamp duty
  on the buy. Routing through `calculate` instead would charge the buy schedule
  on both sides, and a test now fails if anyone does.

- **A zero-quantity position costs nothing.** It places no order, so it owes no
  per-order brokerage. Only visible once this path charged one at all.

### Added

- **`lot_size` and `quantity`** on `TickBacktestConfig` and on the Python
  `run_tick_backtest`, both defaulting to `1`.

- **`fee_segment`** on the Python `run_tick_backtest`, matching the other
  strategy entry points. `Trade.fee_breakdown` is populated when it is set, so
  `fee_breakdown.total()` equals `fees`.

### Changed

- **A negative `quantity` is refused** with a `ValueError` rather than accepted.
  This path is long-only by construction -- it enters at the ask, exits at the
  bid, and places its stop below entry and its target above -- so running it
  against a short would report a trade that could not have happened. Short
  support is a real feature, not a sign flip, and is not in this release.

- **`return_pct` divides by notional** rather than by entry price, so it stays a
  true percentage return and does not move with position size.

### Upgrading

**Nothing changes unless you pass the new arguments.** `lot_size=1` and
`quantity=1` reproduce the pre-0.7.4 numbers exactly, and a test pins that.

**Any stored tick-path result for a position larger than one unit understates
both its profit and its costs, in proportion to the size traded, and should be
re-run** with the real `lot_size`. A 75-lot option backtest was off by ~75x on
both. Because the two errors are the same factor, the reported *percentage*
return was roughly right while every rupee figure -- P&L, costs, equity curve,
drawdown -- was not.

Setting `fee_segment` moves results further: on cheap contracts the real
schedule costs many multiples of the flat rate (158x at a 2 premium on a 75
lot), because the per-order brokerage it adds does not shrink with the premium.

### The options path

Six defects, all under-charging, under-reporting, or both.

**In plain words: an options backtest under-charged its costs by the lot size,
reported the cost of opening a position as zero, and then told you total costs
were zero however much it had billed. A strategy trading a 50-lot contract paid
1/50th of its real costs while earning full-size profit, so it looked better
than it was — and every figure that would have exposed this was either blank or
agreed with itself.**

`options.rs` was the last strategy path still computing its own costs instead of
using the engine's fee model. It now uses the same path as spreads and ticks.

- **Costs scale with the lot size.** `calculate_contracts` returns *lots*, and
  every P&L, cash and equity line multiplied back up by `lot_size` — but all
  three fee calls passed the bare lot count. A 50-lot position was charged as a
  single contract. Unlike the tick defect above, costs and profit were wrong by
  *different* factors here, so net P&L was overstated on every trade rather than
  merely scaled down.

- **The opening charge is reported, and subtracted.** `entry_fees` was hard-coded
  to `0.0` at both trade sites. The charge was really deducted from cash, but the
  local binding died with the block that computed it, so `fees` disclosed the
  exit half alone — and the entry half was missing from `pnl` too, not just from
  the report. `Trade` documents `fees == entry_fees + exit_fees`; here it held
  only because both sides of the equation were wrong.

- **Each charge lands on the side that owes it.** Both sides were priced through
  `calculate`, which assumes every call is an entry, so exits were billed the buy
  schedule — stamp duty instead of transaction tax. Pricing now goes through
  `calculate_side`, and `fee_breakdown` is populated instead of hard-coded
  `None`, so a configured `fee_segment` finally reports its components.

  Measured on a 50-lot round trip against `fee_segment="NFO-OPT"`, the flat rate
  as a share of the real schedule: **0.4%** at a premium of 2, **4.1%** at 20,
  **18.3%** at 100.

- **`total_fees_paid` reports what the run charged.** It fell to a default of
  zero for every options backtest. This path builds its own metrics rather than
  finalizing a `StreamingMetrics`, so it now sums the trade list, as the
  portfolio engine does.

- **`Trade.size` reports contracts, not lots** — consistent with every other
  path.

- **An end-of-data close is paid for out of the equity curve.** *Found while
  fixing the five above, and scope beyond them.* The end-of-data close computed
  fees and pushed a trade but never touched `cash`, and it runs after the loop
  had already written the last equity point from the position marked to market.
  The exit charge appeared in the trade list and nowhere else, and the reported
  end value was one exit charge too high.

  It could not be deferred: correcting the lot multiplier multiplies that
  unrecorded charge by the lot size, so leaving it would have widened the gap
  between the trade list and the equity curve rather than narrowing it.

**Any stored options result should be re-run.** Costs rise and net profit falls,
by more the larger the lot size and the cheaper the premium. Results held at
end of data move further, since closing out is now paid for.

The options path is also now covered: it had three tests, none of which ever ran
a backtest, which is how six defects accumulated in it. Tests moved to
`src/strategies/options_tests.rs` alongside pins for each defect above.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-14

Patch. Multi-leg option spreads charged the wrong costs, four ways at once,
and every one of them billed too little.

**In plain words: a backtest of a multi-leg option strategy under-charged its
costs and then under-reported even what it did charge. The engine billed the
opening trade twice, told you about only half of it, never charged the flat
per-order fee a broker really takes, and ignored how many lots you traded. All
four errors point the same way, so a strategy that loses money could be
reported as making money -- and the cheaper the options, the likelier that is.**

### Fixed

- **A spread round trip is charged twice, not three times.** `calculate_fees`
  computed a full round-trip charge -- its own comment read `// Entry + Exit`
  -- and was called at exit, on top of a separate entry charge that had already
  been taken. The opening side was therefore billed twice, the second time
  against exit premiums rather than the premiums actually paid.

  On a flat 100 premium over a 75 lot at 0.1%, a round trip cost 22.50 where
  15.00 was owed.

- **The trade list now reports the same money the equity curve lost.** The
  entry charge was a local variable that nothing retained, so `Trade.fees`
  disclosed the exit side alone while the curve had been debited for both.
  `Trade` already documented the opposite as its invariant.

  This is the shape of defect that survives review, because every trade-level
  audit passes: the figures are self-consistent, they are simply not the ones
  charged. It is the same failure 0.7.2 fixed for open positions. `Trade` now
  carries `entry_fees` and `exit_fees`, and `fees` is their sum, so the two
  can no longer drift apart.

- **`fee_segment` reaches multi-leg spreads.** `SpreadBacktest` held no fee
  model and never imported one, so the itemized regulatory schedule was
  unreachable from the spread path however the config was set, and only the
  flat proportional rate ever applied.

  This matters more than the rate being wrong. Brokerage is a flat charge per
  order, and a purely proportional model cannot express it at all -- a 4-leg
  structure is 8 orders whose per-order fee was never billed at any premium.
  Because the missing charge is flat, the error is worst on cheap contracts:

  | Premium | Flat rate as % of the real schedule |
  | --- | --- |
  | 2 | 0.6% |
  | 20 | 6.1% |
  | 100 | 25.7% |
  | 400 | 65.4% |

  Measured on a 4-leg structure, one round trip, 75 lot, `fees=0.001` against
  `fee_segment="NFO-OPT"`.

- **Costs scale with a leg's quantity.** Both fee functions used `lot_size`
  alone and never `|quantity|`, so a leg holding two lots was charged as one
  however large the position, while P&L correctly used both.

- **`total_fees_paid` reports what a spread run charged.** The spread path
  never called `record_fees`, so the summary metric read `0.0` for every
  spread backtest regardless of the costs actually taken.

- **A leg holding zero contracts is charged nothing.** Quantity is signed and
  zero means the leg trades nothing, so it places no order and owes no
  per-order charge. Only visible once this path charged a flat per-order fee
  at all.

- **`fee_segment` reaches four more strategy paths.** `options`, `pairs`,
  `basket` and `portfolio` each built a flat percentage model directly,
  silently ignoring a configured segment.

### Added

- **`Trade.entry_fees` and `Trade.exit_fees`**, in Rust and Python, alongside
  the existing `fees` -- which now holds their sum and finally means what it
  documented. Existing readers of `fees` need no change, and serialized
  results from earlier versions still load.

- **`Trade.fee_breakdown` is populated for spreads.** Setting `fee_segment`
  reports the itemized components per trade, summed across legs and both
  sides, so `fee_breakdown.total()` equals `fees`.

### Changed

- **An option left to expire pays no exit-side cost.** A leg exiting via
  `ExitReason::Settlement` is not traded out: no order is placed, so no
  brokerage and no transaction tax are owed. Entry costs stand. Charging a
  full exit there would overstate every structure held to expiry -- the mirror
  image of the undercharge above, and worth naming because fixing costs in one
  direction makes the other error easy to introduce.

- **`MultiStrategyBacktest` drops its unused `fee_model` field.** It was
  constructed, marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`, and read by nothing; the path
  delegates to `SingleBacktest`, which charges its own. Rust callers
  constructing the struct literally are unaffected -- it was private.

### Upgrading

**Any stored multi-leg spread result produced by 0.7.2 or earlier understates
its costs and should be re-run.** How far off it was depends on the premiums
traded and on whether a `fee_segment` was set; on the measurement above, the
real schedule cost between 1.5x (at a 400 premium) and 158x (at a 2 premium)
the flat rate.

Results move in three ways: total costs rise, `trades()` reports a larger
`fees` than before (it now includes the entry side), and `total_fees_paid` is
no longer zero for spread runs. Strategies held to expiry may see costs *fall*
slightly, since settlement no longer pays a trade-out it never made.

Nothing changes for a caller who sets no `fee_segment` beyond the four bug
fixes -- the flat rate remains the default, and single-instrument backtests
are untouched.

Known gap, not fixed here: the tick strategy path (`strategies/tick.rs`)
computes fees from price alone and does not scale them by position size. It is
a separate defect and is left for its own release rather than bundled into
this one. *(Fixed in 0.7.4, which also found the same hard-coded unit size in
that path's P&L and equity curve, not only in its fees.)*

## [0.7.2] - 2026-08-13

Patch, but a consequential one: intraday backtests can now be told to close
their positions before the market shuts, and a position left open at the end of
a run is finally reported as a trade.

**In plain words: a backtest could report profit earned overnight, while the
market was closed — money no trader could have made, because their broker would
have closed the position at the end of the day. There was no setting to stop
it. Now there is, and the results change materially.**

### Added

- **`BacktestConfig(squareoff_time="15:25")`** — force-closes open positions at
  the first bar at or after that local time in each trading day. `None` (the
  default) keeps the old behaviour, so no existing result moves unless you ask
  it to.

  The time is **local**, interpreted through `session_tz_offset_ns`, so it is
  market-agnostic: `"15:25"` with an IST offset is NSE's squareoff, `"16:00"`
  with a zero offset is a UTC-quoted market. Setting `squareoff_time` and
  leaving the offset at its `0` default is the one easy mistake — 15:29 IST
  then reads as 09:59 UTC and nothing fires. Unreadable values raise
  `ValueError` rather than silently disabling squareoff.

  Positions closed this way carry the new `ExitReason::Squareoff` (`"Squareoff"`
  from Python), distinct from `EndOfData`: it is a real trade-out at a real
  in-session price, paying normal exit costs. The engine will not re-enter on
  the squareoff bar itself.

- `core::session::squareoff_flags` — the shared session-boundary helper behind
  it, usable by any strategy path.

### Fixed

- **A position still open when the data ends is now recorded as a trade.** The
  spread path settled it into cash without pushing a `Trade` or calling
  `record_trade`, so its P&L reached `end_value`, `total_return_pct` and the
  equity curve while `trades()` returned empty and `total_closed_trades` read
  zero.

  This is the most dangerous shape a reporting defect can take: every
  trade-level audit passes, because there is nothing to audit. It was found by
  a run whose entire return came from one position opened on the first morning
  and never closed — visible in the equity curve, invisible in the trade book.

- **`BacktestConfig.set_session_config` no longer appears in the type stub.**
  It was declared in `_raptorbt.pyi` and never existed in the engine. Callers
  guarding with `hasattr(config, "set_session_config")` took the else-branch
  every time, so `session_aware=True` was silently dropped and every intraday
  backtest ran with no squareoff. A type checker reading the stub agreed with
  the call throughout.

  A new guard (`TestStubDeclaresNothingFictional`) pins the stub -> runtime
  direction. The existing `TestStubCompleteness` only checked runtime -> stub,
  which is why this was never caught. Verified by injection: reinstating the
  fictional declaration fails the guard.

### Changed

- **`SpreadConfig.close_at_eod` is removed.** It was declared, defaulted to
  `false`, hardcoded to `false` at both binding sites, and read by nothing —
  dead since it shipped. `squareoff_time` supersedes it and is actually
  honoured. A field that looks like a working setting and does nothing is what
  this release exists to stop; leaving it in place would repeat the defect.

  Rust callers constructing `SpreadConfig` literally should drop the field;
  those using `..Default::default()` need no change. No Python API used it.

### Measured

On a real NIFTY option corpus (7 sessions, one expiry), enforcing a 15:25
squareoff moved net-of-cost P&L by:

| Strategy | No squareoff | With squareoff | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short ATM straddle | ₹18,405 | ₹13,934 | −24% |
| Short strangle | ₹7,736 | ₹4,523 | −42% |
| Long ATM straddle | −₹18,627 | −₹15,590 | +16% |

The long straddle moving the *other* way is the important one: the defect does
not add a constant bias, it **amplifies whichever direction a position already
points** — making winners look better and losers worse. On that corpus one
boundary (the night into expiry day) carried 47.1% of all overnight P&L, so the
direction is robust but the magnitude is corpus-specific.

### Upgrading

Existing results are unchanged unless you set `squareoff_time`, with one
exception: a backtest that ended with a position still open now reports one
more trade than it did before. The P&L was always in `end_value`; it is now
also in `trades()`, so trade counts and per-trade statistics will differ for
those runs. That is the fix, not a regression.

If you run intraday strategies, set `squareoff_time` **and**
`session_tz_offset_ns` together — the first without the second silently does
nothing.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-12

Patch. The 0.7.0 deprecated names resolved but could not be enumerated.

### Fixed

- **Deprecated `Py*` names now appear in `dir(raptorbt._raptorbt)`.** They
  resolved through `__getattr__` in 0.7.0, but never showed up in `dir()`, so
  they were invisible to autocomplete and to any tool that enumerates a module.

  That is not merely cosmetic. A consumer guard comparing `_raptorbt.pyi`
  against `dir(_raptorbt)` read the stub's alias block as 21 declarations for
  symbols the engine had dropped -- precisely the "type-checks clean,
  `AttributeError` in production" drift such a guard exists to catch. The
  aliases are real, so they are listed.

- **The stub-completeness test in this repo had two blind spots** and so never
  flagged the above. It recognised `class X`, `def X(` and `X:` but not the
  `X = Y` alias form; and it matched declarations by substring, so `class Foo`
  matched `class FooBar` and a renamed-away class left the guard green. Both
  are anchored now, verified by deletion.

### Upgrading

No API change. If you consume the stub in CI, this is the release that makes
the 0.7.0 alias block agree with the runtime module.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-12

Two things: the public class names lose a prefix that never belonged in Python,
and five places where the engine quietly guessed now refuse instead.

Plain words on the second half, because it matters more. When raptorbt was
handed something it could not interpret -- an option type it could not parse, a
direction that was neither long nor short, a correlation matrix that is not
mathematically valid -- it picked a default and returned numbers that looked
completely normal. Not a crash, not an obviously silly figure: a smooth,
well-formed result computed from something other than what you asked for. No
metric, equity curve, or risk check downstream could tell.

### Changed

- **Every public class drops its `Py` prefix.** `PyBacktestConfig` is now
  `BacktestConfig`, `PyTrade` is `Trade`, `PyRiskModel` is `RiskModel`, and so
  on for 21 classes. The old spellings still work and emit a
  `DeprecationWarning` naming the replacement; **they are removed in 0.8.0.**

  The prefix was a Rust-side disambiguator -- the crate has its own
  `BacktestConfig`, `Trade` and `BacktestResult` in `src/core`, and two Rust
  types cannot share a name -- that was never stripped on the way out.
  `BarAggregator`, `Indicator` and `InstrumentSpec` already reached Python
  clean; this finishes the other 21. Rust struct names are unchanged.

  Deep imports keep working too: `from raptorbt._raptorbt import PyX` warns and
  resolves, because `PortfolioSession` had never been re-exported at top level
  and a deep import was the only way to reach it. It is exported properly now.

- **`max_trades` no longer defaults to 50.** It defaults to unlimited. This is
  a **behaviour change to existing tick backtests**: any run that relied on the
  implicit cap will now return different -- correct -- numbers.

  `max_trades` is a hard early exit, not a filter. The tick loop `break`s and
  the result is reported as if the tape ended there. On a 1,000,000-tick input
  the old default produced 50 trades covering **0.81% of the data**: a total
  return of -0.12% where the true figure was -14.13%, and a max drawdown of
  0.124% against a true 14.13%. That is a 114-fold understatement of the single
  number a risk check reads. The knob remains for anyone who explicitly wants a
  truncated run.

- **`run_options_backtest` string arguments are case-insensitive and closed.**
  `option_type`, `strike_selection` and `size_type` used a catch-all match arm,
  so `option_type="PUT"` selected a long **call** -- the mirror image of the
  intended payoff -- while the identical string was accepted by
  `run_spread_backtest`. The same call meant two different things depending on
  which function you entered through. Unknown values now raise `ValueError`;
  the documented defaults are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **`BarAggregator` ignored `brick_size`.** The constructor accepted the
  argument and then called a helper that hard-coded `0.0`, which
  `resolved_brick` reads as "fall back to `step`". Asking for 5-point Renko
  bricks gave you `step`-point bricks -- a 10-point move produced 10 bars
  instead of 2. **Every Renko backtest built through the streaming aggregator
  was wrong; re-run any stored Renko results.** The batch `aggregate_bars` path
  was always correct. Every pre-existing test used `step=1, brick_size=1.0`,
  where the fallback returns the number you asked for and the bug is invisible.

- **A correlation matrix that is not positive definite is refused, not
  repaired.** Cholesky patched a negative pivot with `sqrt(|diag|)` and a zero
  pivot with `0.0`, then returned success. On an indefinite 3-asset matrix
  (smallest eigenvalue -0.8) `simulate_portfolio_mc` returned `var_95 = 0` and
  `probability_of_loss = 0` -- a risk model reporting no risk at all, from
  input it should have rejected. The identity-matrix fallback beneath it was
  dead code and is gone; substituting one would have made every asset
  independent, the most optimistic assumption available to a risk model.

- **An unparseable option-type code no longer becomes a Call.**
  `OptionType::from_code` documents that "defaulting an unrecognised code to
  Call would price a put as a call", and both PyO3 call sites did exactly that.
  An iron condor whose put legs failed to parse became a four-leg call
  structure. `batch_spread_backtest` multiplied it across an entire sweep.

- **`direction` must be 1 or -1.** Six call sites fell back to long, so a book
  encoded `0`/`1` instead of `-1`/`1` backtested entirely long, flipping the
  sign of the P&L on every short behind a well-formed equity curve. In the
  basket and portfolio runners the parse runs per instrument, so one bad row
  turned a leg of a market-neutral book into a doubled long.

- **`simulate_portfolio_mc` validates its shapes.** Passing an
  `(n_obs, n_assets)` matrix where a per-asset list of series was expected
  indexed past the end of `weights` inside a Rayon worker, surfacing as
  `PanicException` -- not catchable as `ValueError`, thrown from a thread with
  no user code in the traceback. It now raises a `ValueError` naming the
  mistake.

- **A test that never ran now runs.** A duplicated `#[test]` attribute left the
  following function without one, so `day_expires_on_utc_date_rollover` --
  DAY-order expiry across UTC midnight -- silently never executed. It passes.

### Internal

- Build and lint are silent: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes
  and the library build emits no warnings, down from 89 diagnostics. Not by
  suppression -- 8 manual `Default` impls became derives, shift loops became
  `copy_from_slice`, the `w'Σw` quadratic form was deduplicated between the
  optimizer and risk contributions, and `OptionType::from_str` (which shadowed
  the `FromStr` trait, so `"CE".parse()` did not work) became `from_code` with
  a real `FromStr` impl beside it.

  Six `#[allow]`s remain, each with its reasoning in a comment. The load-bearing
  one is `adopt_position`, which guards with `!(price > 0.0)` rather than
  `price <= 0.0` because the negated form is also false for NaN. Clippy's
  suggestion would let a NaN price become a position's cost basis, turning
  cash, equity and every drawdown figure into NaN with no error raised.

  The optimizer index-math refactors were verified against a captured baseline
  of 18 numeric surfaces -- covariance, optimizer weights, risk contributions,
  MACD/RSI/ADX/VWAP, Monte Carlo, and a full backtest's metrics, equity curve
  and drawdown curve. Bit-identical before and after.

- **`benches/python/` ships the benchmark harness** behind every published
  performance figure, so a claim can be re-run rather than trusted.

### Upgrading

Nothing breaks on import. Old class names work for this release.

Three behaviour changes to be aware of:

1. **Renko backtests through `BarAggregator` were wrong** and are now correct.
   Re-run any stored Renko results.
2. **Tick backtests that used the default `max_trades`** were truncated and are
   now complete. Their numbers will change, substantially.
3. **Input that used to be guessed is now refused.** If you were passing
   `direction=0`, an option-type string outside `CE/CALL/C/PE/PUT/P`, an
   unrecognised `strike_selection`, or a non-positive-definite correlation
   matrix, you will now get a `ValueError` naming the argument. Those calls were
   already producing wrong answers; they were just not saying so.

The published performance numbers moved because the harness changed, not the
engine. The 0.6.4 wheel and this build measure at 71.0 µs and 70.5 µs on 1,000
bars on the harness now in `benches/`, with identical results.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-08-10

One defect, one character, and it inverted every multi-leg options backtest.

Plain words: if you backtested a spread — any structure with more than one
option leg, like a credit spread, a straddle, or an iron condor — the result
was reported backwards. A structure that made money showed a loss, and one
that lost money showed a profit. Worse than the wrong number: the automatic
stop-loss read the same backwards figure, so it closed positions that were
*winning*, and the profit target closed positions that were *losing*.

Nothing that trades real money was affected. Paper and live deployments price
their leg groups through a different code path entirely, which was always
correct and is pinned by test. The damage was to research: a user could have
discarded a profitable strategy or deployed a losing one on the strength of an
inverted backtest.

### Fixed

- **Spread P&L is no longer negated.** `LegPosition::unrealized_pnl` computed
  `-quantity * premium_change * lot_size`. `LegConfig.quantity` is already
  signed (`+1` long, `-1` short), so the leading minus applied the direction
  convention a second time and flipped the result:

      short (-1) + premium falls (-30) -> (-1) * (-30) * 75 = +2250, a gain
      long  (+1) + premium falls (-30) -> (+1) * (-30) * 75 = -2250, a loss

  Everything downstream reads that one function, so `pnl`, the equity curve,
  the drawdown curve, and every derived metric — `sharpe_ratio`,
  `profit_factor`, `win_rate`, `expectancy`, `best_trade_pct` — inherit the
  correction.

- **`max_loss` and `target_profit` fire on the right side now.** Both compare
  against the same figure, so through 0.6.3 a max-loss threshold closed
  structures that had gained and a target-profit booked wins on structures
  that had lost. This changes *when positions close*, so a backtest re-run
  under 0.6.4 with either threshold set will differ from its 0.6.3 result by
  more than a sign.

### Upgrading

**Any stored spread backtest produced by 0.6.3 or earlier is wrong and should
be re-run.** `pnl` and every metric derived from it are inverted. Results with
`max_loss` or `target_profit` set differ further, because the exit timing
itself was wrong. Single-leg backtests are unaffected — they never went
through this code path.

### Added

- Nine Rust regression tests covering all four short/long x win/lose cases and
  all four stop/target x winner/loser cases, plus a Python behavior suite
  (`tests/python/test_spread_backtest.py`) exercising the same contract
  against the built wheel. The defect survived because neither existed: the
  Rust tests asserted only that a trade was recorded, and no Python test
  called `run_spread_backtest` at all.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-06

Two defects in position adoption, both on the path that seeds a strategy with
shares a user already owns. Neither was firing in production — the supported
entry point adopts before the run starts, and today's seeded strategies are
long-only — but both were reachable.

This release also teaches the portfolio optimizer to hold short
positions — by explicit configuration only. Plain words: until now the
optimizer could only say "buy, hold, trim, or sit in cash." With
`short_cap > 0` it may also propose NEGATIVE weights: positions that
profit when a price falls. Nothing changes for existing callers — the
default (`short_cap = 0`) poses the byte-identical long-only problem it
always has, pinned by test.

### Added

- **An update notice.** raptorbt now writes one `INFO` log line, at most once
  a day, when the installed version is behind the newest release on PyPI:
  `raptorbt 0.6.2 is behind the latest release 0.6.3. Install the latest
  version: pip install -U raptorbt`. Plain words: it tells you to upgrade,
  and does nothing else.

  It cannot slow or break an import, and **it fails silently by design**: the
  request runs on a daemon thread with a 2s timeout, every failure path is
  swallowed at two independent layers plus a guard inside the thread body, and
  the answer is cached on disk for 24h so a restarting fleet is not a burst of
  requests. An unreachable PyPI is indistinguishable from the check never
  running — no traceback, no stderr output, nothing on the log at all.

  The notice is `INFO` rather than `WARNING` deliberately. With no logging
  configured, Python's `logging.lastResort` prints `WARNING` and above to
  stderr; `INFO` stays under that bar, so the line appears for anyone who asked
  for INFO logs and is invisible to everyone else. A library telling you to
  upgrade has not detected a problem with your program.

  Set `RAPTORBT_NO_VERSION_CHECK=1` to disable it; continuous-integration
  environments are skipped automatically, since a pinned wheel there is
  deliberate. Versions that cannot be parsed as plain dotted releases — a
  pre-release, a local build, or the `unknown` of a source checkout — produce
  no message rather than a wrong one.

- **Long/short mode on `optimize_portfolio`** (`PyOptimizerConfig`):
  `short_cap` (per-name short bound, default 0 = long-only), `gross_max`
  (`sum |w| <= gross_max` — the total size of all bets), and `net_min` /
  `net_max` (bounds on `sum(w)` — the directional tilt; `net_min = net_max
  = 0` is a dollar-neutral book). Gross exposure and the gross sector caps
  are linearized with auxiliary variables (`u_i >= |w_i|`), the same
  epigraph device the turnover term already uses; the variables and their
  rows exist only when shorting is enabled.
- **`gross_exposure` / `net_exposure` on `PyOptimizationResult`.** `cash`
  remains `1 - sum(w)` (net-based) and is documented as such — for a
  long/short book read the exposure fields, not the cash residual.
- **`optimize_book`** as the honest name for the Rust entry point;
  `optimize_long_only` remains as a delegating alias so existing callers
  keep compiling.

### Changed

- **Sector caps are GROSS in long/short mode** (`sum_{i in k} |w_i| <=
  cap`): a cap bounds the size of a sector's bets, not their direction.
  For a long-only book the gross and signed sums coincide, so the two
  modes agree exactly where they overlap.
- A negative `w_current` is accepted when `short_cap > 0` (it is the
  book being rebalanced); still refused in long-only mode.

### Deferred, pinned

- **Short position adoption stays refused** (`short_adoption_stays_refused_
  by_construction`): posted broker collateral is not derivable from
  quantity x average price, and no supported flow seeds a short. The
  refusal is structural — adoption has no direction parameter.

### Fixed

- **A position adopted mid-run made the strategy look less risky than it was.**
  The equity curve is written as the run proceeds, one sample per event,
  against a running peak that starts at the initial capital. Adopting after the
  run began left that curve flat for the stretch before the adoption, which
  held the peak down, so the decline that followed was measured against a
  high-water mark lower than the truth.

  On a 6-bar 100→95 fixture adopting 100 shares at 90, a **0.495%** max
  drawdown reported as **0.199%**. Total return and `open_trade_pnl` were
  identical either way, so nothing in the headline numbers hinted at it — only
  the risk metric moved, and it moved to look safer.

  Because the samples are written as the run proceeds, they are already wrong
  by the time metrics are computed; there is no repairing it afterwards. So
  `adopt_position` now returns an error once any equity sample has been taken,
  raising `ValueError` from Python.

  The gate is the equity curve, not the event cursor: quote and depth events
  advance the schedule without sampling equity (marking on a quote would append
  a zero return per quote and distort annualized metrics by how chatty the feed
  is), and a live feed routinely delivers quotes before the first trade print.
  Adopting after one corrupts nothing and stays allowed.

  `TickStrategyStream(initial_positions=...)` is unaffected — it adopts before
  warmup replay and before the first push, which is why this never fired in
  production. `EngineKernel::adopt_position` holds no equity curve and cannot
  check this itself; a Rust consumer driving the kernel directly owns the
  ordering, and its doc comment now says so.

- **A seeded long/short strategy could not be deployed at all.** A short leg
  only transacts as a short under a margin account — in cash mode its P&L never
  reaches equity — so a strategy holding one runs under margin at leverage 1.0,
  which keeps the book fully funded. Adoption refused margin outright, so the
  seed and the short were mutually exclusive: construction raised and the
  deploy died before it began.

  Fully funded margin books (initial margin rate ≥ 1.0) are now adopted by
  **locking** the cost basis as initial margin rather than debiting cash. That
  is not a cosmetic difference: margin equity is `balance + unrealized`, with
  no position-value term, so a cash-style debit would never be offset and would
  understate equity by the cost basis for the entire run. Relaxing the account
  check without fixing the funding arm would have replaced a loud failure with
  a silent wrong number.

  Leveraged books stay refused, and the original reasoning is why: the margin a
  broker has already posted against a position it holds cannot be derived from
  quantity and average price, and inventing a figure would misstate free
  capital, which gates every later entry. At a rate of 1.0 the whole notional is
  locked and the posted margin simply *is* the cost basis, so the objection
  lapses there and only there.

  **The error message changed** from `"adopt_position supports cash accounts
  only"` to one naming the fully-funded requirement. Callers matching on that
  string need updating.

  The portfolio session now also reconciles the locked delta into its shared
  account, where it previously passed a hardcoded zero. Left as it was, the
  account would never learn about the adopted margin and portfolio free capital
  would read high by the whole cost basis.

  Adoption remains **long-only**: an existing short cannot be seeded. That is
  separate scope — direction-aware cost basis, short proceeds, borrow — and is
  stated here so the boundary is explicit rather than accidental.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-05

A strategy attached to a stock the user **already owns** can now start out
knowing it holds those shares, at the price the user actually paid — without
the engine pretending a buy happened.

### Added

- **Position adoption.** `EngineKernel::adopt_position` opens a ledger
  position with no order, no fill, no fees, no trade record and no `Entered`
  event; cash is reduced by the cost basis, so equity reads as
  initial + unrealized exactly like an account that bought earlier. Without
  this, seeding a holding meant faking an entry — which charged fees that were
  never paid and left a phantom trade in the log.

  `PortfolioSession::adopt_position` applies the same lend/drain pool
  discipline as `apply_current`, so the cost basis comes out of the shared
  cash pool rather than appearing from nowhere.

  Exposed to Python as `PyPortfolioSession.adopt_position(...)` and as
  `TickStrategyStream(initial_positions={symbol: {"quantity", "avg_price",
  "timestamp_ns"?}})`. Adoption runs **before** warmup replay and before the
  first push, so the position is present in every before-snapshot: a caller
  diffing `positions()` around a push can never mistake it for a fresh entry.

  Cash accounts only — margin adoption is **refused, not guessed**, since the
  margin already posted against a broker-held position is not derivable from
  quantity and average price. A seed with non-positive quantity or price is
  rejected rather than silently skipped.

  Design reference: NautilusTrader's position adoption in live-execution
  reconciliation, where adopted state coexists with the order lifecycle
  without synthetic fills. Ported as a design, not as code.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-31

The significance score on factor measurement was overstated, because
overlapping test windows were counted as if they were independent. This
release reports the corrected number alongside the old one.

### Added

- **Overlap-deflated rank-IC t-statistic.** `rank_ic` previously reported only
  the naive IID t-stat, `mean / (stdev / sqrt(n))`. With a 21-day forward
  window on daily dates, consecutive ICs share 20 of their 21 days, so
  `n_dates_scored` overstates the independent sample by ~21× and inflates the
  t-stat by ~sqrt(21).

  Plain words: the same three weeks of market movement was being counted
  twenty-one times over as if it were twenty-one separate pieces of evidence.

  `RankIc` / `PyRankIc` gain three fields, all additive:

  - `t_stat_deflated` — `t_stat / sqrt(horizon)`; **the number to decide on**
  - `n_independent` — `n_dates_scored / horizon`; the sample actually behind it
  - `overlap_days` — the window, so a stored result is self-describing

  The naive `t_stat` is deliberately kept, so the inflation stays auditable
  rather than being quietly corrected away. `n_independent` is `0.0` (not NaN)
  on a panel that scores nothing, so callers can gate on sample size without an
  `isnan` dance.

  This is not theoretical. Measured on a live 2023-02..2026-07 vendor panel
  (1045 names), momentum 12-1 scores IC +0.0386 with a naive t of **+7.15** and
  a deflated t of **+1.56**, over 17.3 independent forward windows — real, but
  a materially smaller claim than the naive figure suggests. The same
  correction took the Indian fund cross-section from t=+4.78 to +1.04, which is
  the measurement that retired funds from the equity model; reporting equities
  on the naive statistic while funds were judged on the deflated one would have
  been exactly that double standard.

  Purely additive — no existing field changes meaning.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-25

An order's `side` now decides the direction a position opens in, so a single
run can hold long and short legs and a leg can flip side once it is flat.
This makes a cross-sectional long/short book — long the winners, short the
losers, rebalanced — expressible in one run against one capital pool.

This release also adds the portfolio-construction maths: how much risk a book
carries, what weights to hold, and what rebalancing actually costs.

### Added

- `Strategy.enter_long()` / `Strategy.enter_short()`, and `enter(side=...)`.
  Without `side`, `enter()` opens in the session's configured direction
  exactly as before.

  `enter()` could previously open only in the session's configured direction,
  so the sided order types were the only way to short — a nine-field kw-only
  dataclass that is easy to fill wrong, and unreachable from a sandboxed
  strategy at all. `enter_long()` / `enter_short()` take no side argument to
  mis-spell. A sided entry passes an explicit `size_frac`, because omitting
  both sizing kwargs means "close the whole position", which an opening order
  refuses — a sided entry that silently rejected itself would be worse than no
  feature.

- **Covariance estimation** (`estimate_covariance` → `PyRiskModel`).
  Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage against a constant-correlation target — plain words:
  a covariance matrix estimated from a few hundred days of returns is mostly
  noise, so it is pulled part-way toward a simpler, steadier matrix. Carries
  `periods_per_year` and the asset ordering structurally, so a risk model
  cannot be silently applied to a differently-ordered basket.

- **Constrained portfolio optimizer** (`optimize_portfolio`,
  `batch_optimize_portfolios` → `PyOptimizationResult`). Long-only quadratic
  program via Clarabel (new dependency, pure Rust) with an L1 turnover
  penalty, per-position and per-sector caps, and explicit cash. Post-solve, a
  no-trade band and a minimum-trade-value rule snap tiny trades away.

  If *all* trades snap away, the result is the status-quo book with turnover
  0 — a legitimate "do nothing" answer. If only *some* snap, leaving weights
  that no longer sum correctly, it **refuses with arithmetic** rather than
  returning a book that does not add up. `batch_optimize_portfolios` runs via
  Rayon and is deterministic: batch results are bit-identical to serial.

- **Factor panels** (`winsorize_panel`, `zscore_panel`, `rank_panel`,
  `momentum_panel`, `composite_scores`). Row-major panel transforms — trim
  outliers, standardize, rank, compute past-return momentum, and blend several
  signals into one score. `NaN` means *absent* and is handled; infinity is a
  hard error, never a silent maximum. No factor list is hard-coded in Rust —
  the caller decides what to score.

- **Rank-IC factor validation** (`rank_ic` → `PyRankIc`). Per-date Spearman
  rank correlation between a factor panel and forward returns at a chosen
  horizon — plain words: does yesterday's ranking of stocks predict tomorrow's
  ordering of returns? Returns the mean IC, the naive t-stat, and an
  overlap-deflated t-stat (see 0.6.1, which added the deflated fields to the
  Python surface). `PyRankIc` carries the panel span and name count, so the
  number is reproducible rather than a constant with a citation.

  First use caught a real artifact: fund momentum on 67 NSE funds read t=+4.78
  naive but +1.04 deflated, and collapsed to +0.016 once the 25 precious-metal
  funds were removed — a metal rally, not a factor. The fund ranking was
  therefore not shipped.

- **Risk contributions** (`compute_risk_contributions` →
  `PyRiskContributions`). Euler decomposition of portfolio volatility, so
  contributions sum exactly to sigma — it says which holdings the risk is
  actually coming from, not merely which are largest.

- **Rebalance policy simulation** (`simulate_rebalance_policy` →
  `PyRebalanceSimResult`, and `indian_cost_schedule`). Simulates a rebalancing
  policy on the Indian delivery settlement schedule, including the flat DP
  sell charge — ₹15.34 per ISIN per day on any day with a sell. That flat fee
  is the cost that dominates small books, and a percentage-only cost model
  misses it entirely. Reports turnover, regulatory / brokerage / DP costs
  separately, and annualized cost drag.

- **Maintenance margin for fully funded positions** — a position covered
  entirely by posted cash no longer contributes a maintenance requirement it
  cannot breach.

### Changed

- **Netting: an order opposing a FLAT instrument now opens** in the order's
  own side, where it was previously read as a close, found no position, and
  was discarded. An order opposing an *open* position still closes it, so
  bracket legs and take-profit orders are unaffected. `reduce_only` orders
  route to the closing branch unconditionally and never open.
- `submit_bracket` marks its stop and target legs `reduce_only`, so a leg
  still working after the position closed by another route cannot open a
  fresh position on the opposite side.
- The kernel's per-instrument `direction` now governs the signal path only
  (`enter()` and the signal arrays). Runs using `direction=` / `directions=`
  without submitting sided orders are bit-identical to 0.5.0.

### Fixed

- Every refused order counts against `rejected_entries`. Previously
  `no_position`, `position_open`, `reduce_only` and `invalid_qty` rejections
  were invisible, so a discarded order looked like an order never placed.
  Sizing refusals (`zero_size`) and unfillable *closes* stay uncounted: they
  are not refused entries.
- An order-path open honors an ATR stop/target config instead of computing
  levels from a hardcoded zero ATR, which silently produced no stop at all.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-21

This release fixes five defects where the engine silently returned wrong
numbers, adds a shared-capital portfolio runner, and introduces the
class-based strategy contract — an event-driven alternative to precomputed
signal arrays.

**Read "Migrating from 0.4.x" before upgrading** — several metrics change
value. Setting `apply_slippage=False, legacy_annualization=True` reproduces
0.4.1 results bit-identically, so stored backtests stay reproducible while you
migrate.

### Fixed

- **Timers and alerts fired for only one symbol in multi-symbol runs.**
  The clock was global, so a timer set in `on_start` fired once for
  whichever symbol's event happened to cross the threshold first and never
  for the rest — a two-symbol heartbeat delivered half its beats, silently.
  Each symbol now has its own clock, carrying whatever `on_start`
  scheduled. Single-symbol runs are unchanged.

- **Options never settled to intrinsic value.** `settle_expiry` called
  `settlement_value(close, None)`, and the `None` meant the option branch
  could never match, so every option settled at its own last close no
  matter how far from intrinsic that was. The strategy can now supply an
  underlying via `ctx.set_underlying_price(...)` — routed per symbol in
  portfolio runs — and without one, contracts still settle at their own
  close, since an option's bars carry the option's price and the engine has
  no second series to read.

- **`TimeInForce::Day` expired on the UTC date, not the trading date.**
  A session whose local hours cross UTC midnight would see DAY orders die
  while the trading date was still running. `session_tz_offset_ns` on
  `PyBacktestConfig` sets the offset — e.g. `IST_OFFSET_NS` — and defaults
  to `0`, which is arithmetically identical to the old behavior.

  This is a latent fix rather than a live bug for NSE users: 09:15–15:30 IST
  does not cross UTC midnight, so the common case was already correct. It
  follows the trading *date*, not the trading *session* — a DAY order still
  survives past the session close to the next session of the same date.

- **Indicator registration was a silent no-op in portfolio runs.**
  `register_indicator` appended to the strategy's list but
  `run_portfolio_strategy` never updated anything, so `.value` stayed `None`
  and `indicators_initialized()` never became true. Indicators now update,
  routed per symbol. Registrations also reset per run, so re-running one
  strategy instance no longer accumulates duplicates (matching
  `run_strategy_backtest`).

- **`modify_order` raised `NotImplementedError` in portfolio runs.** The id
  map already carried the owning instrument; the routed binding was missing.
  Modifies now route without the caller naming a symbol.

- **`max_positions` was per-instrument in portfolio strategy runs.**
  `EventSession` gave each instrument its own copy of the risk gate, and
  `RiskGate` is `Copy`, so every kernel checked the limit against its own
  ledger: `max_positions=1` across three symbols allowed three concurrent
  positions. It is now counted across all instruments, as the array runner
  (`run_portfolio_backtest`) has always done, and is enforced on the
  resting-order path as well as on signal entries. Runs that set
  `max_positions` on `run_portfolio_strategy` will open fewer positions than
  before — the previous behavior did not match the documented meaning of the
  setting or the sibling API.

- **Portfolio session results reported stubbed halt/rejection fields.**
  `PyPortfolioSession::finish` hardcoded `rejected_entries: 0`,
  `halted: false`, and `halted_at: None`, so a `run_portfolio_strategy` run
  could refuse entries or trip its drawdown kill-switch and still report a
  clean, unhalted result. All three now carry real values:
  `rejected_entries` sums the per-instrument counters (already reported
  correctly on `per_instrument`), and `halted`/`halted_at` cover both the
  drawdown kill-switch and the new portfolio margin call.

- **Configured slippage was ignored.** `PyBacktestConfig` accepted `slippage`
  and `BacktestConfig` carried it, but `PortfolioEngine::new` hardcoded
  `SlippageModel::None`, so the model was applied as a no-op. Every bar-level
  backtest run with slippage configured executed at zero slippage. A 0.2%
  slippage on a 9-trade fixture now costs ~3.4% of capital; before it cost
  exactly nothing. `run_tick_backtest` was never affected — it reads `slippage`
  directly and always honored it.

- **Sharpe and Sortino were computed from different quantities per runner.**
  `run_single_backtest` annualized *per-bar* returns at 365, while
  `run_basket_backtest`, `run_pairs_backtest`, `run_options_backtest` and
  `run_multi_backtest` annualized *per-trade* returns at 252. The return basis
  is the more serious half: annualizing trade returns assumes one trade per
  trading day, inflating the ratio by roughly `sqrt(n_bars / n_trades)`. On a
  2-trade/500-bar basket, Sharpe drops from 1.175 to 0.218 once corrected. All
  five runners now share one estimator fed per-bar returns.

- **Calmar was meaningless on intraday data.** Years were derived from bar
  count over 365.25, so an 11k-bar 1-minute backtest was scored against ~31
  "years" of compounding. Years now come from elapsed wall-clock timestamps.

- **Undefined ratios crossed to Python as `inf`.** `profit_factor`,
  `payoff_ratio`, `recovery_factor`, `calmar_ratio`, `sortino_ratio` and
  `omega_ratio` divide by a denominator that can legitimately be zero — a
  strategy with no losing trades has an *undefined* profit factor, not an
  infinite one. `json.dumps` writes `float('inf')` as a bare `Infinity` token,
  which is not valid JSON and which `allow_nan=False` rejects outright. These
  are now `Optional[float]` and return `None`.

- **`__version__` had drifted.** `python/raptorbt/__init__.py` hardcoded
  `"0.4.0"` while the crate was at `0.4.1`, so any version check read a value
  that was never released. It now derives from installed package metadata.

- **`cargo test` could not link, so CI never ran it.** pyo3's
  `extension-module` feature was unconditional; it leaves Python symbols to be
  resolved by the host interpreter at import time, which a test binary cannot
  satisfy. The feature is now opt-in-by-default and tests run with
  `--no-default-features`. CI previously ran only an import smoke test; it now
  runs 198 Rust tests and 16 Python behavioral tests across
  ubuntu/macos × Python 3.10–3.12.

### Added

- **Incremental (live) session feed.** `PyPortfolioSession` gains
  `push_tick`, `push_bar`, `push_depth` and `remaining()`: events append to
  the schedule tail in arrival order after `seal()` (idempotent — batch
  warmup data merges ahead of the first push), and the existing
  `current_event()`/`apply_current()` loop drives them. A batch replay and
  a push-per-row stream of the same rows produce identical results.

- **`TickStrategyStream`** — a Python driver for open-ended live feeds.
  Construct with symbols and optional `warmup_bars`, then `push_tick` /
  `push_bar` / `push_depth` as events arrive; every strategy hook a push
  triggers fires before it returns. `finish()` closes out and computes
  metrics. Shares its dispatch loop with `run_tick_strategy`, with one
  addition in streaming sessions: real bars (warmup or pushed) *execute* —
  they match orders and mark equity — unlike bars aggregated from prints
  via `primary_bars`, which remain a view.

- **Four deferred execution knobs**, all default-off:

  `limit_slippage` applies an adverse adjustment to limit fills, which
  previously always printed exactly at the limit. It is suppressed when
  `queue_fill_model` granted the fill: volume observed trading ahead of an
  order is evidence it genuinely held that price, so slipping it too would
  double-penalize.

  `liquidate_on_margin_call` force-closes positions when a margin call
  fires, instead of only latching a halt. Unlike expiry settlement or
  end-of-data finalization — both of which close free — a liquidation is a
  real trade-out: it prices through the fill model and pays exit costs, and
  reports the new `ExitReason::Liquidation`.

  `InstrumentSpec.settlement_fee` charges a fee on the settled notional at
  expiry. It sits alongside `maker_fee`/`taker_fee` rather than on the
  config because exercise and assignment are commonly priced differently
  from a trade-out, and a portfolio run needs per-instrument rates.

  `EngineKernel::set_underlying_price` lets options settle to intrinsic
  value — see below.

- **TWAP execution schedules.** `orders.Twap(side=..., units=..., slices=N,
  every=<ns>)` releases N equal slices at a fixed interval, each an ordinary
  order reporting its own fill with a client id of `"<parent>#<n>"`. New
  `on_algo_started` / `on_algo_completed` hooks bracket the schedule;
  "completed" means fully released, not necessarily fully filled.

  A schedule is deliberately not an order. Modelling it as a parent would
  deadlock its slices — the one-triggers-other gate holds a child until its
  parent *fills*, and a schedule never fills — so slices carry only a
  back-pointer and the matcher needs to know nothing about them.

  The interval is a duration, not a bar count: `idx` is a bar ordinal in a
  bar session and an event ordinal in a tick session, so "every 1 bar" would
  silently mean "every 1 print" on a tick feed and collapse a five-slice
  TWAP into a burst. Pass `every_bars` with `bar_ns` for bar-shaped
  ergonomics. Slices release one per step even after a data gap, since
  dumping a backlog defeats the point of spreading an order.

  Only explicit `units` can be sliced — `size_frac` resolves against equity
  at fill time, so each slice would size against a different account.
  Cancelling a schedule stops the remaining slices; it does not unwind what
  already traded. Only TWAP ships in 0.5.x; VWAP needs a volume forecast and
  POV needs partial fills, both still deferred.

- **Renko and signed-flow bar units.** Every variant declared in
  `AggregationUnit` now builds; none returns `Unimplemented`.

  `"renko"` emits a brick per full brick-height price move, ignoring time
  and volume entirely. Height comes from a new `brick_size` argument
  (`BarAggregator`, `aggregate_bars`, `bars_from_ticks`, `subscribe_bars`),
  falling back to `step` read as whole price units. Because one move can
  complete several bricks, `BarBuilder` gains `next_pending()` and its
  Python mirror — **drain it after every push or those bricks are lost**.
  Bricks carry no wicks and a partial brick is discarded, not flushed: an
  incomplete brick is not a brick.

  The six information-driven units — `{tick,volume,value}_imbalance` and
  `{tick,volume,value}_runs` — sample by signed order flow. Imbalance closes
  on net flow, so balanced two-sided trading never closes a bar however
  heavy; runs closes on the larger one-sided accumulation, so it does. The
  threshold is `step`, fixed rather than the literature's adaptive EWMA:
  deterministic, reproducible, and consistent with how `step` already reads
  for tick/volume/value bars.

  Direction comes from the feed when known — `TradeTick` and `SourceRecord`
  gain a signed field, populated from the buy/sell quantity deltas that
  `tick_data_to_events` previously summed away. The unsigned `size` is
  unchanged, so no existing bar moves. Without a split, direction falls back
  to the tick rule, which is what lets these units work over plain bars.

- **Order book state and queue-position limit fills.** `OrderBook` tracks
  the visible book from quotes (L1) or depth snapshots (L2, five levels),
  exposed to strategies through a new `on_order_book(ctx, book)` hook,
  `ctx.book`, and a `depth=` argument to `run_tick_strategy`.

  With `queue_fill_model=True` (opt-in, default off), resting limits fill
  from observed queue position rather than `fill_prob_limit`'s coin flip.
  The size ahead is estimated once, when the order rests, then consumed by
  print volume at that price; a print *through* the level fills
  unconditionally. Unlike the probability model, progress is monotone — an
  order passed over repeatedly genuinely gets closer to the front.

  The model claims no real queue rank: without an order-by-order feed there
  is no way to know your position, nor to tell size that executed ahead of
  you from size that was cancelled. It therefore falls back to
  `fill_prob_limit` rather than guessing — on bar events (a bar's volume is
  not volume *at* the limit price) and on a quote-only book (a quote gives
  the price but not the size). A level outside the visible five reports
  "unknown", never "empty".

  Book updates are observation only, like quotes: they never fill an order,
  move a trailing stop, mark equity, or sample the equity curve. They do
  change *future* fills by sizing the queue a new order joins.

- **Tick-driven class contract** — `run_tick_strategy(strategy, ticks, ...)`
  drives the same event session from trade prints and quotes, so orders,
  positions, risk gates and the shared account behave as they do on bars;
  only the resolution changes. New `on_trade_tick(ctx, tick)` and
  `on_quote(ctx, quote)` hooks, `TradeTick`/`QuoteTick` payloads, and
  `ctx.best_bid`/`ctx.best_ask`/`ctx.last_price`.

  Three semantics worth knowing before using it:

  - **Quotes are observation only.** They do not fill orders, move trailing
    stops, or mark equity. Filling against a quote would assert a
    counterparty the engine has no evidence for; the print that follows is
    that evidence. An order submitted from `on_quote` rests and matches on
    the next print.
  - **`ctx.best_bid`/`ctx.best_ask` inside `on_trade_tick` are the book
    observed *before* that print** — the quote from the same feed row
    arrives in the following `on_quote`. Reading it earlier would be a
    lookahead onto a book the print itself moved.
  - **`primary_bars=(step, unit)` builds bars from prints as a view**: they
    fire `on_bar` and feed indicators, but nothing executes on them. Orders
    match against ticks only.

  `AT_OPEN`/`AT_CLOSE` market orders keep resting on a print, since a print
  has no bar phase to queue against. Trailing stops ratchet off every print,
  so a tick run and a bar run over the same data legitimately differ there —
  a bar can trigger a stop against a low that preceded the high which set
  the watermark, and prints cannot.

- **Per-symbol indicators and composite bars in portfolio runs.**
  `register_indicator(indicator, stream_id=None, symbol=None)` gains
  `symbol=` to route an indicator to one instrument, and
  `register_indicators(factory, symbols)` builds one per symbol. One
  `subscribe_bars` declaration now yields one aggregated stream per symbol,
  each built only from that symbol's bars, and `CompositeBar` gains a
  trailing `symbol` field (`None` outside portfolio runs) naming the
  instrument that completed it. A symbol's composite bar dispatches before
  that symbol's `on_bar` which completed it; across symbols, order follows
  the merged schedule.

  Note: an indicator registered *without* `symbol=` in a portfolio run is
  fed every symbol's bars interleaved — rarely meaningful, since one
  indicator cannot track N series — and now warns. It previously did
  nothing at all, so no working strategy changes behavior.

- **Shared margin accounts in portfolio runs** — `run_portfolio_strategy`
  accepts `account_type="margin"` and `leverage`, previously available only
  to single-instrument runs. One account funds every instrument: leverage
  applies portfolio-wide, sizing draws on the portfolio's free capital
  (balance less all locked margin), and equity marks the balance plus
  direction-aware unrealized PnL, so a winning short raises portfolio equity
  instead of lowering it. The maintenance requirement is the sum of each
  instrument's own requirement, so per-symbol `margin_maint` rates apply
  rather than one blended rate; a breach fires `on_margin_call` once and
  halts new entries on every instrument, including symbols that never
  traded. `PyPortfolioSession` gains `free_capital()` and `is_halted()`.
  Cash-account runs are unchanged and remain pinned by the golden fixtures.

  Note: in portfolio runs `halted_at` is a **schedule-event ordinal**, since
  the session interleaves N instrument streams; the array runners'
  `halted_at` remains a bar index.

- **Portfolio drawdown halts now record `halted_at` on the shared account**,
  so margin-call and drawdown halts report identically. A drawdown halt
  keeps its own reject reason (`DrawdownHalt`) rather than borrowing the
  margin-call switch. One consequence: once any halt has latched, a later
  margin-maintenance breach no longer emits a second `MarginCall` event —
  halts are latch-once.

- **`run_portfolio_backtest`** — simulates N instruments against **one** cash
  pool, with `max_positions` and a drawdown kill-switch gating each entry
  *before* it opens, so reported metrics describe the constrained run.

  This is materially different from running one backtest per symbol and summing
  the equity curves, which gives every symbol its own private copy of the
  capital. On 5 symbols with a 500k account, the summed approach reports
  2,381,392 final equity having deployed 2.5m — 5× the account. The shared-pool
  runner reports 478,537 for the same signals.

  Reports `rejected_entries`, `halted`, `halted_at`, and per-instrument
  attribution, so a constrained run is distinguishable from one with no signals.

- **`max_positions` and `max_drawdown_pct`** on `PyBacktestConfig`, enforced
  in-loop rather than by filtering trades afterwards. The kill-switch latches:
  once tripped it stays tripped, since a switch that re-arms on recovery is a
  materially less conservative policy.

- **Itemized Indian transaction costs** via `fee_segment` (`"NSE-INTRADAY"`,
  `"NFO-OPT"`, `"MCX-FUT"`, …), covering brokerage, STT, exchange transaction,
  SEBI turnover, stamp duty and GST across NSE/BSE equity, NFO/BFO, MCX and
  CDS. `trade.fee_breakdown["total"]` equals `trade.fees`, and their sum equals
  `metrics.total_fees_paid` — the itemized costs and the equity curve are now
  the same money.

  Charges land on the leg that owes them: STT on the sell, stamp duty on the
  buy, keyed off `(direction, is_entry)`. GST applies to brokerage, exchange
  and SEBI charges only, never to STT or stamp duty.

  Note: for options, STT and exchange charges are levied on *premium*, not
  contract notional.

- **`session_minutes`** with exported constants `SESSION_NSE` (375),
  `SESSION_MCX` (870), `SESSION_CDS` (480) and `SESSION_CONTINUOUS` (24×7).
  Intraday annualization scales with session length, so assuming NSE hours on
  MCX data understates Sharpe by `sqrt(870/375)` ≈ 1.52×.

- **`periods_per_year`** to override annualization explicitly, and
  **`risk_free_rate`**, wired into Sharpe and Sortino as excess return.

- **`EngineKernel`** — the per-bar simulation body extracted into a steppable
  core (`step(bar) -> Vec<EngineEvent>`). Batch backtests loop it; a live feed
  can drive the same code, which is the groundwork for backtest/live parity.

- **Class-based strategy contract.** Strategies can now be written as Python
  classes with lifecycle hooks instead of precomputed signal arrays:

  ```python
  class SmaCross(raptorbt.Strategy):
      def on_start(self, ctx): ...   # precompute indicators on ctx.close etc.
      def on_bar(self, ctx):
          if crossed_up:   self.enter()
          if crossed_down: self.close_position()
  result = raptorbt.run_strategy_backtest(SmaCross(), timestamps, o, h, l, c, v)
  ```

  Hooks: `on_start`, `on_bar`, `on_stop`, `on_order_filled`,
  `on_order_rejected`, `on_position_opened`, `on_position_closed`. Order
  intents (`enter(size_frac=..., stop_price=..., target_price=...)`,
  `close_position()`) are applied through the same execution core as the
  array runners — `SingleRunner`, extracted from the batch engine loop — so
  identical decisions produce bit-identical trades, curves, and metrics
  (pinned by the equivalence tests in `tests/python/test_strategy.py`).
  `ctx` exposes the OHLCV arrays, current index/bar, position snapshot,
  equity/cash, and programmatic `set_stop_price`/`set_target_price`.

  Entries whose computed size rounds to zero units (size fraction below one
  lot, or insufficient capital at the fill price) now emit
  `EntryRejected { reason: ZeroSize }` instead of being silently skipped;
  class strategies receive it via `on_order_rejected` with
  `reject_reason="ZeroSize"`. Array-runner results are unchanged — the batch
  path ignores rejection events.

  Rust/PyO3 surface: `PyKernelSession` (per-bar `step` driving the engine
  with scalar inputs), `PyEngineEvent`, `PyPositionSnapshot`,
  `resolve_atr_period`, kernel `set_stop_price`/`set_target_price`/
  `position_snapshot`, and `StepInput.stop_price_override`/
  `target_price_override` for per-entry explicit exit levels.

  The array-based runners are unchanged and remain fully supported; they are
  the fast path for vectorized workloads. New strategies should prefer the
  class contract.

- **Type stubs.** `_raptorbt.pyi` and a `py.typed` marker now ship in the
  wheel. The `Typing :: Typed` classifier was previously inaccurate.

### Changed

- **`PortfolioContext` position state matches `StrategyContext`.**
  `position`, `positions` reads for the current symbol, plus `is_flat` /
  `is_net_long` / `is_net_short` / `net_position`, are now PROPERTIES on
  the portfolio and tick contexts, exactly as on the single-instrument
  context — so a bar-style strategy (`if ctx.position is None`) behaves
  identically on the live stream instead of silently seeing a truthy bound
  method and never entering. Cross-symbol lookups are explicit methods:
  `position_for(symbol)`, `positions(symbol=None)`,
  `net_position_for(symbol)`.
- Stop and take-profit fills route through `FillModel`, which handles
  gap-through for all four `(direction, is_entry)` cases; the engine previously
  inlined a long/short-only copy. Behavior is unchanged.
- `compute_backtest_metrics` gained a `timestamps` parameter, and
  `compute_backtest_metrics_with_config` was added for callers that have a full
  config.
- `PositionManager::close_position` takes an `ExitDetails` struct.
- `StepInput` gained `stop_price_override` and `target_price_override`
  fields. Rust rlib consumers constructing it as a struct literal without
  `..Default::default()` must add the new fields; the Python API is
  unaffected.

### Removed

- `signals::expression` (456 lines). It had no parser or AST despite its module
  documentation, was never re-exported, never bound to Python, and had zero
  references anywhere in the crate. Its role is superseded by the class-based
  strategy contract shipped in this release. This is a breaking change only for
  Rust consumers of the rlib that referenced `raptorbt::signals::expression::`
  directly.
- The checked-in `_raptorbt.cpython-311-darwin.so` build artifact and
  `libraptorbt.dylib.dSYM/`. Compiled extensions are now gitignored.

## Migrating from 0.4.x

### Reproducing old results

```python
cfg = raptorbt.PyBacktestConfig(
    initial_capital=100_000.0,
    fees=0.001,
    slippage=0.002,
    apply_slippage=False,        # restores the 0.4.1 no-op
    legacy_annualization=True,   # restores 365/252 and bar-count Calmar
)
```

Verified bit-identical to 0.4.1 across 13 single-instrument scenarios and for
the basket runner, where legacy mode reproduces the old Sharpe to the last
digit. The only unconditional difference is `inf` → `None` on undefined ratios.

### Required code changes

**Optional metrics.** Six metrics are now `Optional[float]`:

```python
pf = metrics.profit_factor
if pf is not None:
    ...
```

A `getattr(metrics, "profit_factor", 0.0)` guard does **not** help — the
attribute exists, so the default never fires and the call returns `None`.
Arithmetic on these fields needs an explicit check.

### Expected metric changes (defaults)

| Metric | Change |
|---|---|
| Sharpe / Sortino (daily, single) | unchanged — daily data still resolves to 365 |
| Sharpe / Sortino (intraday) | increases; annualized on session count, not calendar days |
| Sharpe / Sortino (basket/pairs/options/multi) | **decreases substantially**; per-bar rather than per-trade returns |
| Calmar (daily) | shifts slightly; elapsed time rather than bar count |
| Calmar (intraday) | changes substantially |
| Any run with `slippage > 0` | returns decrease; slippage is now actually charged |
| Everything else | unchanged |

### Recommended

- Pin `raptorbt>=0.5.0,<0.6.0`. A floating `>=` lower bound means an
  unattended upgrade silently picks up behavior changes.
- Pass `session_minutes` for MCX and CDS strategies.
- Replace `hasattr` feature-sniffing with a `__version__` check; it is now
  accurate.
